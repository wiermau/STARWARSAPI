# StarWarsAPI

Assignment

  You have been given an assignment to make a backend for the website of a Star Wars fanclub. The website exists out of a
  couple of pages with dynamic content for which your backend will supply the data.

Framework
  
  • You choose what Node.js framework you would like to use.
  
  • We are going to set up your project locally, so make sure you add documentation about how to set up and use your backend.
  
  • Build a RESTful API of which the endpoints match the below specifications.
  
Exercises
  1. Build an endpoint that, based on a movie search term, will return all the characters of a specific movie. Make sure your pagination is done in batches of 30.
  
    A. Add a filter to the above, which will allow the api to return either male or
    female characters.
    B. Make sure all the characters can be sorted by height in ascending and
    descending order.
    C. (BONUS) Make sure the characters can also be sorted by age (ascending
    and descending).
    
  2. Build an endpoint that, based on a climate search term, will return an object of all the planets that have this climate-type, and a collection of all dark-haired characters that live on this planet.
